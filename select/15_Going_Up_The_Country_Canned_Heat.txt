I'm going up the country
Baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going up the country
Baby, don't you wanna go?
I'm going to some place
Where I've never been before

I'm going, I'm going
Where the water tastes like wine
I'm going where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water
Stay drunk all the time

I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay

Now baby, pack your leaving trunk, you know we've got to leave today
Just exactly where we're going I cannot say
But we might even leave the U.S.A.
'Cause there's a brand new game that I wanna play

No use of you running or screaming and crying
'Cause you've got a home, man
Long as I've got mine
